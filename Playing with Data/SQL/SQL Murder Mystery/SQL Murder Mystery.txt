This is a walk through of my thought process and steps taken to find whodunnit.

So this is how the story goes:
A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.


Right off the bat, we're given a command to get the tables found in this DB. 
These are the results: 
crime_scene_report
drivers_license
facebook_event_checkin
interview
get_fit_now_member
get_fit_now_check_in
solution
income
person


SELECT *
  FROM crime_scene_report
 where date = '20180115' and city = 'SQL City'

This command helps me to identify the actual crime and gather more details relevant to this crime.
Luckily for me, this query only returns one murder. 
The report indicates there were some witnesses, Annabel who lives on Franklin Ave and our second witness who lives on Northwestern Dr.

Next, I ran this query to get details about this named witness.
SELECT *
  FROM person
  where name like '%Annabel%' 

I took the person ID from the result and headed over to the Interview table to get the details.

SELECT *
  FROM interview
  where person_id = 16371

From the interview, I got some details personally relating to Annabel that helped her identify the killer. I checked the tables and found that there was a table with gym membership records where I ran the query below.

SELECT *
  FROM get_fit_now_member
  where name like '%Annabel%'

From this result, I took the id as a relation to her gym membership and used it to check the checkin records.

SELECT *
  FROM get_fit_now_check_in
  where check_in_date = '20180109'

We find out that Annabel was there for an hr from 4pm to 5 pm. We find out that there were two people also at the gym during this period. I recorded their membership details aside and tried to chase down leads from the second witness(just to confirm who of the 2 is really guilty and also coz its more fun than just guessing between the two).

SELECT *
 from person
 where address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr' 
 order by address_number

From this query, we can get the details about the second witness. I took the person_id and ran the following query:

SELECT *
 from interview
 where person_id = '14887'

Now I do have to admit, I was lucky there was only 1 gym in the DB provided. The second witness, Morty, gives us the name and more clues about the criminal. I have cross checked the details from the interview with the 2 membership details I had noted down early.
Morty's interview also revealed some critical information, that the criminal had left in a car and he had remembered the license plate.

And I found the murderer but the caviar was still to come

From this interview, I got some details about a suspect and started chasing down this lead. By looking at the drivers_license table, I found three possible personnel that matched the description given.

From this, I decided to chase down the other lead from the interview. The suspect had claimed that he was paid by a woman who attended an event thrice in December. I checked the facebook event checkin table and deduced who'd dunnit.
